# Stoicism

Things from this branch of Philosophy I found worth pondering upon:

## Acknowledges that _Life is Difficult_

Finally! no _mumbo-jumbo_ or _jargon_ of complexity here. It acknowledges
that _life is difficult_.

I was anticipating that I might need a Cigar and Glass of Cognac, to babble
and ponder on something __abstract__. Phew! off to a good start!

## Diverse Backgrounds of the Philosophers

This is amazing! I always was under the impression that:

> Philosophy was only a rich person's thought process, because why would
> a poor person think over philosophy if he needs to solve the need for 
> basic amenities like: _food_, _water_, _shelter_ ?

but it turns out there is a lot of diverse background of the main
philosophers:

- [Zeno of Citium][zeno]: once a wealthy merchant, lost everything in a 
shipwreck, decided to visit a bookstore and stumble upon philosophy. Actual _riches to rags_.

- [Epictetus][epictetus]: born into slavery yet was able to be calm and
composed

- [Seneca][seneca]: statesman to Nero! (Yikes!) and was forced to take his
own life by Nero. Yet he held his ground

- [Marcus Aurelius][marcusAurelius]: last of the __Five Good Emperors__ of 
Pax Romana. Last I checked, being an emperor of Rome involved a lot of
_back-stabbing_

Okay getting the hold of it. I can respect a philosophy that is made up
of thoughts of people from all spheres of life.

## Why this philosophy might work?

Following Points work out:

### No _Sugar-Coated Hope Capsule_

- Life is hard and everyone has problems, everyone has to face them and resolve
them in their own capacity.

- No false and fake positivity is going to override this reality of a harsh, cruel life

- We will be okay! Better prepare for the worst-case scenario, but chances
are, we probably might be able to make it out __just fine!__

### Anger stems from misplaced hopes with unforeseen reality

Expect __Murphy's Law__ on everything and everyday:

> If something is bound to happen, it will happen

Why let the circumstances get to you, when you know they might be inevitable?

Do things that are in control and not worry about things that aren't in your control,
because _they are not in your control!_

### Let that Negative thought wash over you, not sweep you off

As a statistician would say:

> there might be equal probabilities of us enjoying life or suffering from a 
> bad one!

Rather than be anxious and wreck your self with a nervous breakdown, suffer
it through your imagination. Let that worst-case scenario playout in your
mind and let it shed those tears.

But always remember this fantastic Quote from Seneca:

> __We suffer more in imagination, than in reality__

That project at work, you think will never work out, that thought you might
think would never fair well with your manager and get you fired is worth
taking an action on! You might imagine you might be fired, you have already
lived a million simulations of suffering, yet you come out stronger because
the outcome might not be worse than you thought of.

If it works out, you are happier, confident and more relisient! If it didn't
you already knew the consequences and you are still resilient and confident 
because you predicted it near-perfectly and happier because you did what you
think was right! I see a _win-win_ here.

_We are all in this harsh world together!_

The sooner we realize the more accepting we become and the calmer we become to
the outcomes that may not be in our favour.
