## Rules of Stoic Software Development

Thoughts that have helped me personally using the [Core Concepts of Stoicism](./01_CorePrinciples.md)

### Step 1: Dichotomy of a Project's Control

Oftentimes, I might think a project / codebase is the ultimate thing
and will be highly appreciated by my Work Colleagues / Open-Source Community.
Yet, this often might lead to frustrations, disappointments which are the 
fault of my own aspirations. 

Remember that line:

> Anger stems from misplaced hopes with unforeseen reality

Maybe the problem was already solved, out-right useless or way ahead of its
time. This is where I separate the things that are within my control and 
things that aren't.

__Within My Control__: understand the problem, solve it, provide results upto my
satisfaction and understanding

___Out of My Control__: whether it is approved, appreciated or utilized by others

In a nutshell, give it all you got irrespective of what the outcome is. Someone might
benefit from it someday, if not, you will leave your desk a satisfied human for giving
it all you had in your skill arsenal

As a practical example, take __Linus Torvald's__ quote on whether he finds it annoying
that people sell __GNU/Linux__ commercially

> One of the reasons that I really don't mind that people are selling Linux commercially 
> is exactly because it does make me feel good that people use the product.

So be satisfied that you had a shot at tackling a challenge and you gave it your best shot!
Anything beyond that is out of your control and no point worrying about how it might perform

### Step 2: _Memento Mori_ in Software

Like all things in the world, projects and codebases die! Either they are abandoned for something
new, or there is no use of it at all.

If you code is dead or abandoned, you could ponder upon whether you can _open-source_ it so that
people might take inspiration from it. Let them rise as a phoenix from your code's ashes.

You have to accept that and move one. If you can help someone with your experience or your code
that should be the _do, say and act_ part of this philosophical aspect.

If you know your code is obsolete, try documenting it till the best of your abilities and put
it out there! Archive it if you have to, but let is be other there for the greater good of others

### Step 3: _Amor Fati_ in Software

Your job dealt you the deathblow of a horrific codebase and you have to maintain it or improve it.

Crying about it or complaining about it might be our initial reaction. I remember a friend of mine
once said something in the lines of

> You can complain about it for 30 minutes and be dissatisfied. You can perhaps find a solution in
> 15 minutes and save that 15 minutes of your time being a happier than you were 15 minutes ago!

You accept it, take a blow to the chin and smile at it and say thank you as you start finding a 
solution. The more you deep-dive, the better you are going to get at it. And even if you stopped /
quit half way you are still a tad-bit better experienced that you were had you only complained 
about it.

### Step 4: Journal your Code

Toughest pill to swallow is that documentation is not everyone's forte.

In software I have increased my _journaling_/_documenting_ capacity by starting small, i.e.,
Single Sentence Issues in your repository or Kanban Boards.

Why not begin the work day by just creating the necessary tasks for the day as issues on your
personal Repo or kanban board!

It feels burdensome at first, but once those clicks on __Close Issue / Tickets__ start to 
increase, there is no better satisfaction professionally knowning that you came today with a goal
in mind, and you are leaving the workplace achieving most of what you planned to achieve.


### Step 5: All it takes is one bad day!

We stress ourselves over the _what ifs_ of something going horribly wrong. Chances are, they 
are _going_ to go wrong. Has happened before, is happening right now, will inevitably happen
in the future.

Let's repeat that quote from __Seneca__ again:

> We suffer more in imagination, than in reality

Rather than letting all the worst-case scenarios worry you to death. Accept that it will happen
one day and be ready with all the sharpened skills you have accomplished till date. Chances are
a good insight into such scenarios has already made you aware of where to look for when the 
storm hits the coast.

Irrespective of what happens, remember that you __will be okay, you will survive it!__.

If you need more solace, nothing will even matter once you have left this earth.

### Step 6: Say No to a lot of things, in order to say Yes to things that matter

As a rule of thumb:

> We won't hesitate to give 10 minutes of our time to someone who asks for it, knowing that
> those 10 minutes are never coming back. On the contrary, you will hesitate to give 10 bucks
> to someone knowing that they will be worthless over the course of time!

We get it! Money is important. No denying that. Not everything could be refused in the line of 
duty! However, as a free person, you also have the power to prioritize. Your priority of
satisfaction and happiness, should outweigh all other things.

If you wish to lie to yourself, be my guest, but a happier human is more productive than a rich
person. You owe nothing to this world, but you owe it to yourself to be happy. You could cry about
your sorrows in your private yacht, however don't let the yacht itself be the reason for your sorrows.

There is more to life than just work, as long as work is enjoyable, or even tolerable go with it. If 
not, say No and move on! You might be sacrificing your happiness, in order to make someone else rich,
who in turn will never be satisfied.

Say No to things, to make up time for things that genuinely deserve your attention.


## Personal Inferences

- __Step 1__: has most certainly reduced anxiety, provided a better understanding of _carpe diem_

- __Step 2__: has provided me a way to achieve more personal satisfaction in professional / personal projects. 
It provides me the motivation of doing my best till the end and not worry about what happens beyond

- __Step 3__: has provided me the reason to _do more, babble less, complain the least_

- __Step 4__: my ticket / issue management skills are off the charts :D, not to mention `Markdown` skills.
It has helped me chart my course, achieve the things my employer wants me to achieve and progress ahead

- __Step 5__: has provided me with resilience. You can't make me suffer more than what I have already suffered
through in my own imagination, amirite?!

- __Step 6__: I now get to work on personal projects more in Open-Source than ever before. It has helped me 
be more optimized and I get to work on what I want and spend time on hobbies or things I wish to engage with.
